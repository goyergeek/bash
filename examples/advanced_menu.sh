# This example shows a more advanced method of displaying, navigating, and executing menu options.  It uses three functions 
# and one outside file to accomplish the task.  The outside file contains information for both displaying menus, and also 
# what to do when a selection is made.
 

# Read contents of menus.sh into the script file.  This makes it as though this code was part of the current script file.
# See comments in menus.sh for additional details on file structure.
. menus.sh

# display_menu() does exactly that. It takes menu data provided in menus.sh and uses it to display a nicely formatted 
# menu to the screen along with a prompt.  The character used to draw the menu can be altered by changing the value
# of $ch. $ch is â–‘ ($'\u2591') by default, and is declared at the start of the function.  display_menu() can handle
# up to 99 options, at which point formatting of the numbers will break down, as there is not enough padding for 3
# digits.  The function will allow you to pass an array with more than 99 options, but it will not display correctly.
